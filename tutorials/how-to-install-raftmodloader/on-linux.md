# How to install RaftModLoader on Linux

The person who wrote this guide loves Linux, free-and-open-source stuff, he uses Bash instead of PowerShell and Clangd+Vim instead of Visual Studio. After installing Ubuntu and playing some other games on it, he discovered a unique piece of software: [Wine](https://winehq.org). This made him able to run Raft...

Going on, the first thing you need to do is:

## 0. Get Raft
Go to your Windows PC, find the Raft installation folder (explained [here](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=7418-YUBN-8129)) and copy it over to your Linux computer. On my desktop it's placed in `~/Desktop/Raft`, so change the paths accordingly to where yours is located.

## 1. Download the Launcher
The same as you would do on Windows. Go to the [download page](https://www.raftmodding.com/download) and place it somewhere (for example, I placed it in `~/Desktop/Raft` - my Raft folder).

## 2. Install Mono and .NET 4.6
First of all, if you haven't already, install `winetricks`. On Ubuntu it's just `sudo apt install winetricks`.

Then download Mono 5.0 .MSI from [this link](https://dl.winehq.org/wine/wine-mono/5.0.0/wine-mono-5.0.0-x86.msi) and run `wine uninstaller` to launch the Add & Remove Software dialog. Point it to the downloaded installer and wait until it completes.
After installing Mono, you need another thing: .NET 4.6. It can be installed from Terminal using `winetricks dotnet46`. It'll warn you about Windows Modules Installation Service missing but that's not a problem.

## 3. (Recommended) Install DXVK for better performance
If your graphics card supports Vulkan rendering then you shouldn't skip this step. Grab a release from [here](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/latest), unpack the archive to `~/Downloads/` and run this in Terminal from the `~/Downloads/dxvk_x.y.z` directory where x.y.z is the version:
```bash
WINEPREFIX="$(dirname ~/.wine)/.wine" ./setup_dxvk.sh install
```

## 4. Use RaftModLoader as you're on Windows
Run RMLLauncher via Wine: `wine64 ~/Downloads/RMLLauncher.exe`. It'll ask you for your Raft folder. From what I've checked, updating is fine, injections work and Raft starts. If you have issues, contact @null#0170 on Discord.

# Known Issues

## Raft won't respond after Alt+Tab
There's nothing I can do to that - it's a issue that happens on many other Unity games, especially when they're running on Wine. From what I've seen, changing focus to a window on another monitor doesn't trigger this. 

## Injection failed
Wait a second, Raft will open and mods will still work.

## The program `csc.exe` has stopped unexpectedly
I think this can be fixed by using Mono's `csc` but that would probably involve changes in RML's code.
